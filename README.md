# pyMath
An implementation of numerical methods, specific to linear algebra, from first principles.

## Class Modules:
[//]: =========================

#### Polynomial
Homogenous polynomial functions of a single variable are coded as arrays of coefficients. 
Includes standard methods for:
  - multiplication, division, addition and subtraction
  - derivation
  - variable evaluation

##### Legendre Polynomial:
An implementation for the generation of Legendr√© Polynomials to the specified degree.

#### Matrix
Composite class for numpy arrays to primitively deal with scalar & vector space matrix algebra.
Overwrites standard operators (*,+,-) to accommodate matrix operations.
Includes the standard methods for:
  - Inverse
  - Determinant
  - Transpose
  - Echelon Form
  - Several Row and Column Operations
